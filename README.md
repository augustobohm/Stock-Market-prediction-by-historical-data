# Stock-Market-prediction-by-historical-data

The stock market is a complex system that is influenced by a multitude of factors, making it difficult to predict future prices accurately. However, with the help of machine learning algorithms, we can analyze large amounts of historical data and use it to make informed predictions about future market trends.

In this project, we will be using Python to build a machine learning model that can predict stock prices based on historical data. We will begin by collecting and cleaning our data, selecting relevant features, and then used Random forest regression to predict the days that the market will go up.

After that, I applied a backtest to reach more concise results by setting a custom threshold so if it's greater than 60% chance that the price will go up, the model will go up. This reduced the days that the price will go up, but increase the chance of it.
